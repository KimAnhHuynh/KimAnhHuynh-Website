        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello! I am KimAnh Huynh, a student at the University of California Riverside, who recently started this past fall 2022. I will be pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business Administration here with a concentration in marketing. Later, I am hoping to earn my MBA, which might be continued at UCR or I will apply to other Universities and Ivy Leagues in order to reach my goal. My plans at UCR as of now is to continue my pursuit in business marketing, which will hopefully lead me to the fashion or music industry in the future. Currently to achieve these goals I am taking intro to business and will be continuing business courses like finance and accounting later on in the year. By exploring different areas of business I can be sure that I am well prepared for any problems that may arise, therefore I will be able to handle them just as well as the people who are specialized in the field. <br><br>

        I am an ambitious worker, I love keeping myself busy with lots of activities which really keep me going. I volunteered at many business events in order to grow my network, an event I am most proud of is VICA. VICA is the Valley Industry Commerce Association where I was able to meet with different guest speakers and attended meetings where they talked about the upcoming economic habits. Secondly, I worked closely with theGranada Hills and North Regional Valley Chamber of Commerce, where I assisted in multiple volunteer opportunities which promoted small businesses. These volunteer experiences have allowed me to market myself. I am always looking forward to engaging myself in activities that will grow my network and also enhance my knowledge of the business industry.<br><br>

        My goals for the future are to claim concentration in the marketing field in my second year of college and expand my access to opportunities from there. I will go into many internships and the goal is to land my first job offer through these internships before I graduate. I would also like to travel while earning my degree to explore the world and also for more connections around the world. Learning about how businesses work in different countries and how places operate will give me more insight on the workings of the business world. Overall, I want to be able to gain more experience through my time in college in order to prepare fully for the real world. As one can tell I am an ambitious worker, I keep myself busy, and I am up for the challenge.
